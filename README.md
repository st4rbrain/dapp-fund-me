# DApp - Fund Me
- This repository contains plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is used to create a simple frontend interface for the FundMe smart contract.
- It uses an ethers.min.js file that imports the **ethers** library to interact with the smart contract.
- It also uses the Metamask browser extension that can be used to interact with the blockchain.

  - Wait for the transaction to complete and you will see the notification (Funded Successfully)
  - Check the contract balance by clicking on the balance button
  - Look for the changes made in the Transactions and Insights boxes<br>
  ### And Voil√†! You just made a transaction.ü•≥

  ## Make Transaction to your own contract:
  - Follow these steps to deploy your FundMe contract:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me
    cd foundry-fund-me
    forge build
    ```
  - Create a .env file similar to the .env.example file and replace the existing values with your own
  - Deploy on Sepolia/Mumbai by running the command:
  
      ```bash
      forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol --rpc-url $NETWORK_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
      ```
  - Update your constants.js with the deployed contract address.
    <br>Replace the SepliaETH / mMATIC values in the `contractAddress` object with your contract address.
  - Refresh the frontend page and now you will see your contract address shown in the contract label and the owner is your account address.
